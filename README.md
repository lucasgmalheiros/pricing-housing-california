# California Housing Prices

Applying machine learning techniques to the [California Housing Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) to predict the prices of listed homes.

The challenge proposed in the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646) requires exploratory analysis of data, application of preprocessing techniques, application, comparison of models, and improvement of parameters.

The analyses, discussions and results are available at [house-analysis](https://github.com/lucasgmalheiros/pricing-housing-california-/blob/main/house-analysis.ipynb).
